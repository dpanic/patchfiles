# PATCHFILES
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/dpanic/patchfiles)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dpanic/patchfiles)

I came to the idea to create patchfiles, when I saw lots of config files people create.

Patchfiles implements various config scripts into one single bash file which you can run on freshly installed system.


**NOTICE:** Patchfiles is not replacement for Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt, Terraform etc. It's purpose is to be simple small one liner which configures single server or desktop machine.
 
## IMPLEMENTED:
* sysctl.conf
* open files limit
* sshd secure server
* tune initial window size

System automatically builds revert.sh script, whcih can bu run in order to revert back changes.

## BUILT AND TESTED ON
* Ubuntu 20.04

## PATCH (INSTALL)
Start as a root:
```
bash <(curl -L -s https://github.com/dpanic/patchfiles/releases/latest/download/patch.sh) all
```

## REVERT (UNINSTALL)
Start as a root:
```
bash <(curl -L -Ss https://github.com/dpanic/patchfiles/releases/latest/download/revert.sh) all
```

## HELP
Invoke help with following command:
```
bash <(curl -L -Ss https://github.com/dpanic/patchfiles/releases/latest/download/revert.sh) help
```
